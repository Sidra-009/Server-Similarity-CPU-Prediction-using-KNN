# Server Similarity & CPU Prediction using KNN

## Project Overview
This project simulates server performance data (CPU, Memory, Network Traffic) for multiple servers across several time intervals and applies **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** for similarity analysis and CPU usage prediction. It demonstrates how KNN can be used in a real-world server monitoring scenario for both similarity detection and forecasting.

## Features
- **Server Data Simulation**: Generates CPU (%), Memory (%), and Network Traffic (Mbps) data for multiple servers across 5 time intervals.
- **KNN Similarity Analysis**: Finds similar servers based on combined features (CPU, Memory, Network).
- **Visualization**:
  - Heatmaps for CPU, Memory, and Network usage.
  - Euclidean distance matrix to show server similarity.
  - Clustermap for server similarity clusters.
- **CPU Prediction**: Uses KNN Regression to predict CPU usage at the next time interval.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Plots predicted vs actual CPU usage for each server.

## Libraries Used
- `numpy` – For numerical operations and data simulation.
- `pandas` – For structured data handling.
- `scikit-learn` – For KNN similarity and regression.
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` – For data visualization.
